# Football Python Mini-Lessons

A set of Python mini-lessons designed for teaching fundamentals through football data.

# Python Mini-Lessons (Football Analytics)

This repository contains beginner-friendly Python lessons built around a custom football dataset I designed for modelling xG, overperformance, defence strength, and recent form.

These lessons are designed to demonstrate:

- clear beginner teaching explanations
- Python fundamentals (conditionals, functions, loops, lists)
- real-world data logic from my football model
- clean, structured code for technical training

## Planned Lessons

1. xG Battle — Conditionals  
2. xG Overperformance — Functions  
3. Defence Thresholds — Comparisons & Lists  
4. 6-Game Rolling Form — Loops & Slicing  
5. Weighted Team Rating Model — Mini Project  
6. SQL Examples — Basic Queries  
7. Prediction Function — TypeScript Version  

This repository is actively being developed as I complete new lessons and build out the full teaching portfolio.
