# Football Analytics Python Mini-Lessons

A Technical Training Portfolio by Benjamin Fuller


# Purpose of This Repository

This repository contains a series of mini Python lessons designed and delivered using a sports analytics context — specifically football (xG, overperformance, defensive metrics, form, and weighted ratings).

Each lesson teaches a core programming concept, paired with a real-world football metric, to make technical learning:

- clear 
- engaing
- meaningful
- practically applicable

This repo also serves as part of my professional portfolio as I transition into technical training and L&D roles within tech, combining:

10+ years of teaching & curriculum design
Python programming
data modelling
sports analytics
explainability and structured training design

# Why Football Analytics? (My Training Approach)

Football data provides an ideal environment for teaching programming:

- Why Football Analytics? (My Training Approach)
- Football data provides an ideal environment for teaching programming:
- It is numeric, structured, and rule-based
- It naturally aligns with conditionals, functions, loops, feature engineering, and evaluation logic
- Most learners find sports context engaging and accessible
- It mirrors many principles used in AI/ML pipelines:
  
      - engineered features
      - thresholds
      - weighted scoring
      - encoded outcomes (-1, 0, 1)
      - rolling averages
      - decision rules
  
This makes football performance data a powerful vehicle for teaching both:
- fundamental Python skills
- real modelling logic used in AI systems

# Lesson Structure
every lesson follows a consistent pattern:
- A real football metric (xG battle, overperformance, defence strength, form, ratings)
- A Python concept (conditionals, functions, loops, dictionaries, slicing, weighting)
- A working .py file
- A teaching-oriented README.md
