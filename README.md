# **Football Analytics Python Mini-Lessons**  
*A Technical Training Portfolio by Benjamin Fuller*

## **What This Repository Teaches**

This repository contains a complete set of beginner-friendly Python lessons built around real football analytics metrics.  
Each lesson teaches one **core programming concept**, using a simple, structured, rule-based football problem.

Across the full set of lessons, learners build understanding of:

### **Python Fundamentals**
- Conditionals (`if / elif / else`)
- Functions & return values  
- Loops  
- Lists & slicing  
- Dictionaries  
- Weighting and simple modelling logic

### **Technical Training Skills**
- Clear rule explanation  
- Translating real-world logic into code  
- Clean, structured Python scripts  
- Teaching-oriented documentation  
- Real examples, test cases, and reasoning

### **Foundations of Analytics & AI**
Football data naturally aligns with concepts used in AI/ML:
- engineered features  
- thresholds  
- numeric encodings (–1 / 0 / 1)  
- rolling averages  
- weighted scoring  
- decision rules  

Football is therefore an ideal and engaging vehicle for teaching programming.

## **The Training Philosophy (Why Football Data?)**

Football performance data is:

✔ numeric  
✔ structured  
✔ rule-based  
✔ meaningful  
✔ engaging  

This makes it highly effective for teaching programming concepts in a way that is:

- intuitive  
- memorable  
- practical  
- directly relevant to real modelling workflows  

The teaching principle throughout this repository is:

> **“Learn the concept → apply the rule → run the code → interpret the result.”**

This mirrors the workflow used in analytics, feature engineering, and basic AI systems.

## **Lesson Structure**

Every lesson follows a consistent structure:

### **1. A real football metric**  
xG battle, overperformance, defensive strength, rolling form, weighted ratings, predictions.

### **2. A single Python concept**  
Conditionals, functions, loops, lists, dictionaries, slicing, weighting logic, or TypeScript basics.

### **3. A working `.py` (or `.ts`) file**  
Clean, readable code designed for beginners and training delivery.

### **4. A teaching-oriented `README.md`**  
Each lesson README includes:
- the rule  
- the decision logic  
- the final polished code  
- example test cases  
- how the lesson would be taught in training  

This mirrors professional technical training design.
